                warning_text. If the warning is detected, client shall destroy the ivi_surface
                object.

		When a warning event is sent, the compositor turns the ivi_surface object inert.
		The ivi_surface will not deliver further events, all requests on it are ignored
		except 'destroy', and the association to the ivi_id is removed. The client
		should destroy the ivi_surface object. If an inert ivi_surface object is used as
		an argument to any other object's request, that request will [produce a fatal
		error / produce a warning / be ignored].

                surface_create will create a interface:ivi_surface with numeric ID; ivi_id in
                ivi compositor. These ivi_ids are defined as unique in the system to identify
                it inside of ivi compositor. The ivi compositor implements business logic how to
                set properties of the surface with ivi_id according to status of the system.
                E.g. a unique ID for Car Navigation application is used for implementing special
                logic of the application about where it shall be located.
		if a wl_surface which already has another role is set, the server regards this as
		error and disconnects the client.
